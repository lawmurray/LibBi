title: 'RBi package: Use LibBi within R'
---

The [RBi](http://www.libbi.org/related.html) package for using LibBi within R is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbi/index.html).

With thanks to [Sebastian Funk](http://sbfnk.github.io/), RBi has developed significantly over the last few months, and now provides a complete interface for using LibBi from within R, including manipulating models, writing input and output files, running LibBi and processing results.

Install the package with

    install.packages('rbi')
    
from within R.
