The latest development snapshot of LibBi can now run on Windows (under Cygwin)
for the first time, and includes updated installation instructions for Mac OS
X. If this is of interest to you, please try installing and report back so
that any problems can be fixed for the next stable release.

See these two threads on the mailing list for more information, and to report
any problems:
