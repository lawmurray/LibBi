LibBi README.md
===============

[LibBi](http://www.libbi.org) is used for state-space modelling and Bayesian
inference on modern computer hardware, including multi-core CPUs, many-core
GPUs (graphics processing units) and distributed-memory clusters.

The staple methods used in LibBi are those based on sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC). This includes particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) and SMC^2
methods. Extra methods include the extended Kalman filter and some parameter
optimisation routines.

LibBi consists of a C++ template library, as well as a parser and compiler,
written in Perl, for its own domain-specific language that is used to specify
models.

See the `INSTALL.md` file for installation instructions.
