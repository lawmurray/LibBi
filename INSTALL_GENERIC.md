# Generic installation

The suggested configurations for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows are given
in the `INSTALL_LINUX.md`, `INSTALL_MAC.md` and `INSTALL_WIN.md`
files, respectively. This file provides additional detail for other
platforms or custom installs.

## Requirements

The following packages are required:

  * a C++ compiler (GCC, Intel and Apple's `clang` are known to work),
  * [GNU Autotools](http://www.gnu.org/software/): autoconf and automake,
  * [Thrust](http://thrust.github.com) 1.6 or later,
  * [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) 4.2 or later,
  * [QRUpdate](http://qrupdate.sourceforge.net),
  * [GNU Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/),
  * [Boost](http://www.boost.org) 1.43 or later, specifically
    Boost.Random and Boost.TypeOf,
  * a [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/) implementation,
  * a [LAPACK](www.netlib.org/lapack/) implementation.

Note that you should install, where applicable, both the compiled
libraries and headers of these libraries. On some Linux distributions
the headers are contained in separate packages of the same name with
`-devel` appended.

For GPU support, the following additional packages are required:

  * [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/cuda) 5.0 or later (including CUBLAS and
    CURAND),
  * [MAGMA](icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/) 1.2.1 or later.

The latter can be difficult to install and, in fact, is not required
for almost everything that you might like to do with LibBi. You may
like to do without it.

For MPI support, the following additional packages are required:

  * An MPI implementation,
  * Boost.MPI and Boost.Serialization.

The following packages are optional for building documentation and
visualising models:

  * [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org),
  * dot,
  * graphviz,
  * pod2latex,
  * latex2html,
  * pdflatex.
