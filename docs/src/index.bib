  title = {Bayesian State-Space Modelling on High-Performance Hardware Using
	{LibBi}},
  note = {In review},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {LibBi is a software package for state-space modelling and Bayesian
	inference on modern computer hardware, including multi-core central
	processing units (CPUs), many-core graphics processing units (GPUs)
	and distributed-memory clusters of such devices. The software parses
	a domain-specific language for model specification, then optimises,
	generates, compiles and runs code for the given model, inference
	method and hardware platform. In presenting the software, this work
	serves as an introduction to state-space models and the specialised
	methods developed for Bayesian inference with them. The focus is
	on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods such as the particle filter
	for state estimation, and the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC)
	and SMC^2 methods for parameter estimation. All are well-suited to
	current computer hardware. Two examples are given and developed throughout,
	one a linear three-element windkessel model of the human arterial
	system, the other a nonlinear Lorenz '96 model. These are specified
	in the prescribed modelling language, and LibBi demonstrated by performing
	inference with them. Empirical results are presented, including a
	performance comparison of the software with different hardware configurations.},

  title = {On collapsed state-space models and the particle marginal {M}etropolis-{H}astings
	sampler},
  note = {In review},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {We investigate nonlinear state-space models without a closed-form
	transition density, and propose re-expressing such models over their
	latent noise variables rather than their latent state variables.
	In doing so the tractable noise density emerges in place of the intractable
	transition density. For importance sampling methods such as the auxiliary
	particle filter (APF), this enables importance weights to be computed
	where they could not otherwise be. As case studies we take two multivariate
	marine biogeochemical models and perform state and parameter estimation
	using the particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) sampler, within
	which is an APF component. For that APF, we compare several proposal
	strategies over noise variables, all based on lookaheads with the
	unscented Kalman filter. These strategies are compared using Markov
	chain convergence and acceptance rates, along with a newly introduced
	conditional acceptance rate that is useful for assessing the impact
	of using an estimated, rather than exact, likelihood. Results indicate
	the utility of designing proposals over the noise variables, particularly
	for fast-mixing process models.},
