 *   @ingroup math
 *
 *   @defgroup math_multi_op Matrix and vector batch operations
 *   @ingroup math
 *
 *   These operations are BLAS-like operations that are performed on multiple
 *   input arguments simultaneously. Each accepts a @c P argument indicating
 *   the number of operations to be performed. Vector arguments are passed
 *   as matrices of @c P rows, where each row gives a vector. Matrix
 *   arguments are passed as matrices with @c P times as many rows as usual,
 *   with rows of each of the @c P matrices interleaved.
