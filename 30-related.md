Provides a complete R interface to LibBi. This includes functions for manipulating LibBi models, for reading and writing LibBi input/output files, for converting LibBi output to provide traces for use with the coda package, and for running LibBi from R.

RBi can be installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbi/index.html) from within R:

    install.packages('rbi')

OctBi is a package for [GNU Octave](http://www.octave.org) with functions for
plotting the outputs of LibBi. It is not a complete environment for calling
LibBi from within Octave, however.

OctBi should also work with MATLAB, but has not been thoroughly tested with it as yet.
